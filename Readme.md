# What is a Zine?
zines are cute little comics that you can print out, and fold horizontally to form a physical booklet. Because of this you will see that in a zine the first pdf page is split in two. With the top part being the first page, and the bottom part being the last page. While this can be pretty handy if you want to print it out and have it near you physically for refference, its convinent for reading normally with a pdf viewer. So using this tool you can convert them to a layout thats easier to read.


# Installation
The easiest way to install is to install as a python package, like so:
``` bash
pip install unzine
```

**Maybe add a way to install with git?**

# Usage
